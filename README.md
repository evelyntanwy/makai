# māKai

### A recipe search website to help you with the hardest question in life. - What's for dinner?

<br />

I have chose this name māKai because the meaning for : -
`kai` (maori) ~ food, meal
<br />
Another reason for the name is because with my Malaysian background, `makan` means food I thought it would be nice to have both the meaning of it.

The reason behind creating this website was to put my daily problem which is searching up recipes and deciding what to eat into a working website.

cd makai

I'm using the API from https://www.edamam.com/ with the Recipe Search API. Creating an account with them as a developer allows me to have a certain limit of clicks per minute.
